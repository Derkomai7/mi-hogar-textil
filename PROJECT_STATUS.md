## 🚧 Pending & Next Steps
*   **Image Management (Priority 1):**
    *   *Current Issue:* Unsplash URLs are unstable and sometimes inappropriate.
    *   *Plan for Next Session:* Migrate away from hotlinking Unsplash. We will switch to using locally hosted images.
    *   *Action:* User to verify/provide downloaded images -> We will host them in the project (`/public/images`) or a stable external source (Drive/Cloudinary) and update `products.js`.
